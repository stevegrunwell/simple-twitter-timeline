# Simple Twitter Timeline

There are a ton of Twitter classes out there. Some simply return tweets and others are full-blown Twitter applications. SimpleTwitterTimeline strives to fall in the middle - retrieve tweets from the public timeline, apply some basic filters, then let the developer decide what to do with them.

There are a number of filters built into the class:

* Link Parser: Automatically create `<a></a>` elements from links in tweets
* Profanity Filter: Automatically censor blacklisted words/profanity (not yet complete)

## Roadmap

* Write more tests!
* Finish the profanity filter
* Complete documentation
* Additional modules?
